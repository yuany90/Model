The program shows how to load obj file in java.

The library named "objLoader.jar" came from <a href= 'http://www.pixelnerve.com/processing/libraries/objimport/'>OBJ_IMPORT</a>.
However, it didn't work on my NetBeans and a few mistakes happened. So I modified the source code to make it more suitable for Netbeans JOGL Applications.
And I tests the new one on several obj files and it works prefectly.
